- My name is Sam Dunnachie/FinniKey and I live in Christchurch, New Zealand.
- I'm interested in computer graphics, webapps, reading anything I can get my hands on, and creating interactive fiction games.
- I am currently developing BetterReads. It is an application that takes a Goodreads profile and returns reviewers that are similar in taste.
- I am looking for a full-time job in the IT industry and so am happy to collaborate on projects involving tech I am not familiar with to expand my skillset.
